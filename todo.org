* Collision system for aabb
- items should be pushed by entities
- I was going to say entities should stop each other, but nah entities just can't collide (problem fixed)
- Pillars and objects in the world should stop entities from exiting them
- I also want to add a "reverse" collision so that instead of making 4 walls around a room,
  you just say that stuff should be inside the boundry of all the rooms and corridors
* Dungeongeneration v3
Plan is to use BSP (Binary Space Partitioning),
should way simpler and faster, but we will have to see on game feel.
* Smooth camera
simply add a "current" pos and a "goal" pos and then each frame move towards goal pos
for a non-linear experience make the speed of the camera scale with something
change shaders to have perspective translation as well
* Upscale with combo shader instead of just nearest
